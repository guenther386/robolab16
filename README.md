Here is some code for ev3, a linux-based OS for Lego MINDSTORMS robots, written in Python3 for 2 different 'planets.'

**For further informations: the documentation [ev3dev](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/) helped alot.**

You can access your robot over Putty, FileZilla or simply through the command line using ssh.
